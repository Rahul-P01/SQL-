# 📊 30-Day SQL Mastery + LeetCode 150 Plan

Welcome to my **SQL Mastery Journey** 🚀  
This repository documents a **30-day structured plan** to master SQL for **Data Engineering** roles, combining:
- 📚 Daily learning tasks (theory + practice)
- 🧑‍💻 Real-world case studies with Kaggle/public datasets
- 🏆 150 LeetCode SQL problems solved
- 📂 Organized GitHub project structure with recruiter-friendly READMEs

---

## 🎯 Goals
- Build **deep SQL expertise** for data engineering interviews (MAANG-level).
- Solve **business problems** with SQL (ETL, analytics, optimization).
- Showcase a **portfolio of SQL projects** with clean documentation.
- Complete **150 LeetCode SQL problems** in 30 days.

## 📅 Daily Structure
Each day includes:
1. **Learning Tasks (2–3)** → Core SQL concepts  
2. **Case Study** → Real-world dataset problem  
3. **LeetCode Practice (5 problems/day)** → Easy, Medium, Hard mix  
4. **Documentation** → Polished README for at least 1 problem
